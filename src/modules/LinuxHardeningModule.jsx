Access can be constrained on such variables as which users and applications can access which resources. These resources may take the form of files. Standard Linux access controls, such as file modes (-rwxr-xr-x) are modifiable by the user and the applications which the user runs. Conversely, SELinux access controls are determined by a policy loaded on the system which may not be changed by careless users or misbehaving applications."

AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing both known and unknown application flaws from being exploited. Many Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE) ship with AppArmor. Simply run aa-status to see if your Linux distribution already has AppArmor integrated. Each time AppArmor denies applications from doing potentially harmful operations the event is logged. Depending on your system the AppArmor events can be seen in the syslog, auditd, kernel log or in journal logs."

This is to help users further learn how these privilege escalations work and keep it in line with the rules, for self-directed exploitation, laid out for the OSCP, HTB, and other CTFs/exams."
